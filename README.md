# Zombification 100
Set the chance of a villager being zombified independent from the game difficulty.

Also allows you to set the chance of a zombified villager to be able to pick up loot and to be persistent.

All chances are set to 100% by default, change them in the config.

This mod is only required serverside, so you can put it on your server and play with a vanilla client.
